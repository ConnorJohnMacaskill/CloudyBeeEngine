- Earth hit by meteor, barely any resources.
- Lots of humans killed as a result.
- Authorities resorted to nuking their own populations to prevent riots, only some could live on. Not enough for everyone.

"TBH I wouldn't be surprised if the remaining authorities don't resort to sporadic use of nuclear weapons against population centers to clear out mouths that have no hope of being fed, or target large masses of refugees on the move."
